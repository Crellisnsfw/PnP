Everyone must be respectful and kind to each other. No slurs or offensive language, just bursting bladders and good times. Play full teasing is allowed, tho no insulting bring others down for any reason. Don’t make people feel bad for how they play or how long they hold, cause at the end of the day we are here to have a good time.

  

The use pads or a towel to sit on is recommended for minimizing any damage from messes. Not a requirement but just a safety precaution. Wetting is not required but is a possibility of happening regardless of if u plan on waiting till u burst or not.

  

Participants are responsible for any unwanted wetting or damage caused by wetting or hold. These incidents are not the servers, dungeon masters, or other party members fault.

  
  

All participants must hold unless dm approves otherwise. 

  

sessions must start with everyone drinking. for hold sessions, their are certain places one can pee without punishment. 

  

if traveling, roll a charisma check to decide if you can stop to pee.

  

If in combat, you can roll to see if you can sneak off to piss, with stealth or evasion check, and if you do, you lose two turns. 

  

Various “pee spots” can be provided, where players can pee without punishment. 

  

whenever character drinks, player must also drink. Amount drank is equal to difficulty amount. 

  

Sometimes thirst debuff is applied, which gives disadvantage on all roles, and stacks for each thirst debuff applied. When thirst debuff is applied role a 1d20 and multiply results by 50 to see if and how much they drink (in ml). Debuff is removed upon finishing assigned drink amount. Additionally:

  

•if a 17-19 is rolled no drink is necessary (effects removed but still counted towards stack until next thirst debuff is cleansed.) 

  

•if a nat 20 is rolled debuff is removed

  

•if a nat 1 is rolled drink amount is doubled

•If three thirst debuffs stack, u get the severe dehydration debuff. The same rules apply as above, but I order to remove amount drank must reach or exceed 1000ml. Additionally, while under severe dehydration, max health is reduced by 10% (round to highest number). 

  

If a player pees, the wet debuff is applied, giving disadvantage on their next roll and save of every stat, plus normal, hit and damage roll.

  

u can buy clothes and carry them with u. However, if you wet a pair of clothes, once u change out of those clothes they can not be worn again until washed 

  

U can wash clothes during your long rest. if u run out of clean clothes then your stuck with the wetting debuffs until u can get clean clothes.

  

• Pants can’t be changed in combat, and must roll a stealth, intimidation or persuasion check before changing (d10). If failed, player can choose not to change. If player chooses to change,  keep debuffs till next roll for each stat. 

  

If the diaper item is equipped, it negates wetting de-buffs. Item is destroyed upon use.

  

holding difficulty will be decided by whichever  difficulty u decide on Shizuku during the start of the session.

  

at the start of the session each player must drink 

•250ml for easy

•500ml for normal 

•750 ml for hard

•1000ml for legendary

  

during the drink time, each player must drink 

•100 for easy

•175 for normal

• 250 for hard

•350 for legendary

or suffer the thirst debuff.

  

If players character drank between drink times ignore thirst debuff effect.

  

additionally, not drinking will give disadvantage on all roles if not done at drink time, or when thirst de buff applied and rolls to drink. Drink time occurs every 15-20 min, or when dm says. disadvantage increase with each additional drink time skipped until hydration occurs, which will then remove the debuff. 

  

If playing an omo subclass, disregard the drink time rules and all IRL drinking requirements for subclass are reduced by half. 

  

If participants start feeling pain from hold, and desire to pee for health reasons, the safe word “safe word” and be used for a bathroom pass. Safety first 😊 

  

Additionally, if the party dies, they may do a randomly assigned legendary challenge issued by shizuku. The members who pass have there characters revived.
