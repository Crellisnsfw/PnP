Each character will have a bladder size and control. The size depicts how much u can hold before 100%. Control is odds of being able to hold passed 100%

  

At and above 100% bladder saving rolls occur. If you fail a bladder save your character wets themselves, giving them the wetting debuff (character and irl wetting debuffs stack with each other). Current bladder capacity will be determined by holding checks, which are character size system + dice checks for holding over 100% of the characters capacity. Diuretic drinks count as 1.5 times the amount drank.

  

For every  5% increase above "full" a saving throw requires 1 more point to pass. Ex: 100% = roll 1, 105%= 2, 150%= 11

  

Holding checks occur every hr after drinking or when the dm calls for a check, fullness is determined by amount drank between character pees.

  

if above 100% roll a str check, if fails, roll a str save. Bladder saves can also occur when a character gets hit with bludgeoning damage or fails an intimidation save, but in these cases the 1st str check is ignored. In cases of bludgeoning damage, the value of your roll is subtracted by the value of the difference between the hit roll and the players AC. Nat 20s count as double.

  
  

Additionally, each stat helps with this new mechanic:

Con gives bonus bladder size

Str gives a bonus on bladder saving rolls

Dex gives a bonus on in combat piss checks

Int gives bonus on diuretic identification in your drinks.

Wis gives the character a reduced fill rate.

Char gives a bonus on wetting and thirst debuff rolls.

  

The value of each trait is determined by saving roll stats.

  

base bladder size is 500ml for all characters, then roll 4d6 for additional capacity and subtract the lowest number, + constitution modifier and multiply that by 100ml. 

  

If a character wets, that character gets disadvantage on all stealth, evasion, acrobatics, intimidation and charisma rolls, as well as giving enemies advantage on scent based perception checks, until pants are changed. Wetting debuffs stack.
