# Pee N Pee - Homebrewed DnD with Omo Elements & rules
 ## TLDR:
Hello! And welcome!  
Here you will find different rules and rulesets for the different types of campaign we host as well as individual rules for character’s bladder.

  

For your in-game character we have the Character Bladder rules, to make it as fun as possible.

➢ [[Character Bladder Rules]]

  

For your average(ish) omo lover that likes to hold their pee(and perhaps occasionally wet themselves) we have the Holders campaign.  
Standard set of rules with a set timer as to when the players(irl) have to drink.

➢ [[Holders Campaign Rules]]

  

For more watersport lovers(exhibitionist, peeing outside etc) we have the pissers campaign.  
(note: no rules have been finalized for this kind of campaign yet as there haven’t been a lot of ask for this kind of campaign)

➢[[Pissers Campaign Rules]]

  

And for our more daring adventurers we have the bladder buster campaigns, this has a more challenging ruleset.

(note: the rules listed are not final, its a beta version)

➢ [[Bladder Buster Campaign Rules]]
  

We also have different homebrewed subclasses, items, curses and spells:
