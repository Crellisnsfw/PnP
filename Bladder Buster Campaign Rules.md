BETA: 

Same as holders rules, see ⁠No Access for details. However, instead of drinking at set times, u drink to use ur abilities.

Magic: 
cantrips- cantrips can be replenished at any time, for any amount. Do like if u expend like 5/10 cantrip slots, u could like replenish 3 of them mid fight then the rest after if u want. Number of cantrip slots are equal to spell slots, each cantrip costs 1 cantrip slot.

50 ml per cantrip.

Spells- spells can only be replenished once completely depleted. So if u had 5/10 spell slots then u would need to cast 1 or more spells that meet or exceed 5 spell slots. If it exceeds, drink for the difference on top of all your spell slots. Additionally, they can only be replenished out of battle. 200 ml per spell slot

Both slots are emptied upon wetting.

Class abilities:
Cost 500 ml per use, but are only 300 ml if character can use spells. If wetting occurs, lose access to class abilities for 2 encounters.

Rests:
Long rests- All drink costs are reduced to 1/5 of their drink costs to replenish at long rests. Ex: cantrips are 10ml, abilities are 100 ml, spells are 50 ml.

Short rests- If a player wants to regain health during a short rest, may either drink 100 ml per point, or reroll their hit die for 500 ml.


Traits that cause ability or spell slot restoration during short rests implement long rest costs.



Misc: 
For non magic classes, enchanted items/weapons need the player have drank at least 1000 ml to be able to access the enchantment’s. If wetting occurs, this requirement is reset and another 1000 ml will need to be consumed. 1000 ml requirement Carrie’s over between sessions.

Approved omo themed classes ignore ability and magic rules in favor of their kits.
